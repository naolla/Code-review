# AI Code Review Assignment – Eskalate

This repository contains my completed submission for the **AI Code Review Assignment** for the **AI Training Software Engineer** role at **Eskalate**.

The goal of this assignment was to review AI-generated Python code, identify correctness issues and edge cases, apply safe and minimal fixes, and rewrite explanations so they accurately reflect the final behavior.

## Repository Overview

This repository follows the required structure exactly and includes:

- `task1.py`, `task2.py`, `task3.py`  
  Original AI-generated code (unchanged, as instructed)

- `correct_task1.py`, `correct_task2.py`, `correct_task3.py`  
  Corrected implementations with minimal, safe fixes

- `submission_template.md`  
  Complete written review for all three tasks, including:
  - Code review findings
  - Proposed fixes
  - Explanation rewrites
  - Final engineering judgments

---

## Work Completed

For each task, I have:

- Identified logical bugs, edge cases, and incorrect assumptions
- Fixed the code while keeping the structure close to the original
- Avoided unnecessary refactoring or over-optimization
- Ensured safe behavior (no division by zero, no crashes on bad input)
- Rewritten explanations so they match the actual code behavior
- Provided clear engineering judgments (approve / request changes / reject)

All fixes prioritize **correctness, clarity, and maintainability**.
